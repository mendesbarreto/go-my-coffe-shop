# go-my-coffe-shop

I will try to build a simple backend for a coffee shop in go

### Run the project

First we need to install the project dependencies

```bash
brew install bufbuild/buf/buf
```

## Tech Stack

- [ ] gRPC for internal microservices communication
- [ ] REST for external communication (I will try to pen a graphQL after, let's see)
- [ ] MongoDB for the database
- [ ] Use Passkey for login
- [ ] Use Docker for deployment
- [ ] Use Kubernetes for orchestration
- [ ] Use Prometheus for monitoring
- [ ] Use Grafana for visualization
- [ ] Test Jaeager for tracing
- [ ] Use logz.io for logging
- [ ] Use pulumi for infrastructure as code
- [ ] Use solid-js for the frontend
